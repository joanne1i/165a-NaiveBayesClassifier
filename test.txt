found the game a bit too complicated not what i expected after having played and ,0
i ve bought and played all of the anno games since and spent more hours than i can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes i was thrilled to see another installment released but i absolutely will not pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs wake up ubi look at all of your other software title reviews both here on amazon and on gaming sites people are not as stupid as you think and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software by adding drm you ve actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it because those that really do want to play it will find a way ,0
i m sure i would love the game if i could play it i have loved all the hitman games thus far the one star is due to steam steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do not help you if you ask them i found out after i purchased it that windows xp does not support direct x i do have a high end video card but it doesn t make a difference i recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business my favorite option i am very good with computers built mine so that is not the problem as always it s a steam issue ,0
update june deeply disappointed at the lack of a non linear open world environment but its the restrictive qte gameplay and final kill cut scenes that kill the game for me i loath enforced qte when a mission goes awry and you re trying to escape a hail of bullets if you happen to brush past an assailant you can t escape qte mode meanwhile you re being shot at from all sides it just lacks the sense of freedom that blood money had and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second rate interactive movie as a loyal fan of the hitman franchise i waited years for this i would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival saints row or the gta series etc what they did add took away from the game for instance they should have kept the semi open worlds of blood money and build on those beautiful sets maps and locations i would have loved if hitman had been as open as skyrim overall dishonored s gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience but i wish they had had bioshock infinite s breathtaking visuals in that particular game wow after all these years waiting this is it i am still a huge fan of blood money the fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus to play all you have to do is watch a second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level who can complain about that but this what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of metal gear solid intuition stop stop stop please let me use my own intuition and what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you re an idiot all this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere tension and suspense you want to know how bad this game is they use cut scenes for the final kill thus killing any sense of pay off and you can t even skip through the intro level hello this was a cult game so lots of people know how to play it and don t need this hand holding to be mandatory the graphics too are little improvement over blood money and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games there is less of a non linear feel about this version also now you re not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor imho such a shame such a shame but good for me as i embark on a career in video game design it gives me confidence that i might have something better to bring to the table ,0
i bought this and the key didn t work it was a gift and the recipient wasn t able to solve the problem it might have been a good game but i never found out because the key failed ,0
i still haven t figured this one out did everything as instructed but the game never installed strange since i don t like to rate on something i couldn t get to work i ll just say that i didn t like it because i couldn t get it to work p for those that did manage to get it installed i m sure it s a great game i had the first dirt and it was a scream too bad this one bombed maybe a bad disc ,0
dirt was like this i m becoming more more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open internet to play it just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason i don t care what they say publicly any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight and nobody s looking it s quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know you re being tracked but this type of continuous spying is something more that aside this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security cons requires open internet windows live to play annoying interface continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do most settings don t keep between sessions setting up a race takes way too long irritating music you can t turn off it keeps coming back takes too long to unlock things entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating i just wanted out video stuttering possibly my equipment pros eye candy plenty of game modes enough tracks to get going fairly good variety of cars scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced i think this franchise like many others continues soley for the purpose of farming user information where it seems the real money is if i can t turn it off and some else controls the on off switch that s a problem sometimes it might be worth it but not here i found some entertainment value but very briefly anyway just my opinion ,0
crashed in vista codemasters told me they don t support it in windows couldn t get it to work even after looking on the internet ,0
installing the game was a struggle because of games for windows live bugs some championship races and cars can only be unlocked by buying them as an addon to the game i paid nearly dollars when the game was new i don t like the idea that i have to keep paying to keep playing i noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to dirt i tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game i m really tired of arcade style rally racing games anyway i ll continue to get my fix from richard burns rally and you should to http www amazon com richard burns rally pc dp b c ref sr ie utf qid sr keywords richard burns rally thank you for reading my review if you enjoyed it be sure to rate it as helpful ,0
in today s game market it s easy to miss racing games that aren t part of the license heavy forza or gran turismo franchises dirt for pc is in an even worse boat than most since it s been a giveaway for a couple years now with every dx compliant ati video card as a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to ebay and most people who do play it have not bought it new this is a shame because dirt is a fun little game there s a great assortment of multinational tracks and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from as a rally game dirt ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns dirt wears a veneer of noisy fun arcade style game play but under the hood it calls for quick reactions a good understanding of road surfaces and nerves of steel sadly it also calls for a gamepad or wheel you will almost certainly find the keyboard too all or nothing for serious racing pros visually stunning engine that makes full use of directx effects soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely european and not too intrusive successfully models an arcade like complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling in car camera gives a stomach churning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and wheel hairpins probably the most realistic depiction of drifting powersliding to appear in a video game it s frightening nauseating and usually a bad idea d support cons lower difficulties aren t much fun highest difficulty is brutally hard small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers dirt players seem pretty nice though essentially requires some sort of analog input may confuse players who aren t familiar with the rules and conditions of rally style racing other thoughts you need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to youtube i don t think codemasters wants to rip you off but if it makes you uncomfortable create a new google identity for use with dirt easy learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracks if you want to win employ a fin ,1
glad i got this for my collection ,1
bought for future investing collecting paper included isn t personally signed by the guy its just a copy and this actually dropped in price in the last months since i purchased ,0
great order it has the guides that i need great price gets down to every little detail in the game ,1
as a big zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since i own all of these games it was a no brainer for me as i ve gotten older it s been harder to enjoy zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i don t have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade the golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from wind waker the guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through if you love loz and own these games get this before they re gone ,1
this is one of the coolest box sets i ve ever purchased i like the minimalism of the books themselves hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders different color for each game titles on spine they simply look amazing the chest box is pretty cool too but i m not as impressed with it since i generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf but it s a great tie in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with zelda games my only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced i paid closer to to get them all brand new on ebay this set will surely devalue my existing ones since i m planning on now reselling them but i had to get this set since it included the oot d guide that you can t get separately i really don t get why they would release this set so close to the guide for a link between worlds did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide or actually include the new guide in this set in a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release but oh well not that big of a deal i will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like twilight princess did ,1
too much delay and sensitivity out of this microphone for rb ps makes it unplayable ,0
this microphone is unbelievably good for what it is it s not studio quality but you simply will not find a mic this good for less than the only problem i had with it at all was trying to get it on a mic stand since it doesn t have a screw but even that wasn t hard to overcome ,1
i bought these to use with band hero and with the voice games for xbox it worked well plugged into the xbox without any issues the microphone worked properly and was just as seller had described my voice is heard clearly on it and we were able to play both games usuing this mic great deal with the price i would recommend it ,1
bad product not working with my xbox and pc ,0
absolutely horrible it wasn t even logitech it was konami and it froze my xbox one repeatedly when i unplugged it these also sound horrible with rock band compared to the mic the game comes with ,0
