found the game a bit too complicated not what i expected after having played and ,0
i ve bought and played all of the anno games since and spent more hours than i can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes i was thrilled to see another installment released but i absolutely will not pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs wake up ubi look at all of your other software title reviews both here on amazon and on gaming sites people are not as stupid as you think and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software by adding drm you ve actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it because those that really do want to play it will find a way ,0
i m sure i would love the game if i could play it i have loved all the hitman games thus far the one star is due to steam steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do not help you if you ask them i found out after i purchased it that windows xp does not support direct x i do have a high end video card but it doesn t make a difference i recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business my favorite option i am very good with computers built mine so that is not the problem as always it s a steam issue ,0
update june deeply disappointed at the lack of a non linear open world environment but its the restrictive qte gameplay and final kill cut scenes that kill the game for me i loath enforced qte when a mission goes awry and you re trying to escape a hail of bullets if you happen to brush past an assailant you can t escape qte mode meanwhile you re being shot at from all sides it just lacks the sense of freedom that blood money had and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a second rate interactive movie as a loyal fan of the hitman franchise i waited years for this i would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival saints row or the gta series etc what they did add took away from the game for instance they should have kept the semi open worlds of blood money and build on those beautiful sets maps and locations i would have loved if hitman had been as open as skyrim overall dishonored s gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience but i wish they had had bioshock infinite s breathtaking visuals in that particular game wow after all these years waiting this is it i am still a huge fan of blood money the fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus to play all you have to do is watch a second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level who can complain about that but this what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of metal gear solid intuition stop stop stop please let me use my own intuition and what is it with the game constantly talking to you like you re an idiot all this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere tension and suspense you want to know how bad this game is they use cut scenes for the final kill thus killing any sense of pay off and you can t even skip through the intro level hello this was a cult game so lots of people know how to play it and don t need this hand holding to be mandatory the graphics too are little improvement over blood money and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games there is less of a non linear feel about this version also now you re not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor imho such a shame such a shame but good for me as i embark on a career in video game design it gives me confidence that i might have something better to bring to the table ,0
